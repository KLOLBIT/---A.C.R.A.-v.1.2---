# ---A.C.R.A.-v.1.2---
A.C.R.A. v.1.2 represents a prosthetic model of the Anatomically Correct Robotic Arm (which I designed for my Leaving Certificate technology project) that uses strings, as tendons, to accurately control each finger as well as the wrist of the arm. It has three distinctive major parts: the hand, wrist, forearm; each of the given part has been 3D printed (using PLA plastic, which, to be frank, was not the best choice for the little active parts, due to the occuring friction and pressure, therefore I would personally recommend to use ABS plastic) and you can see the 3D models of the parts in the given repository.       I must notice, that the given version of prosthetic is still a prototype example, and it has its issues, as: the unreliable wrist construction, made out of the fragile plastic ball connector and rubber bands; really high energy consumptions because of the inappropriate and cheap microcontrollers (installed due to the budget constrains); not really durable, since only glue was used to connect the parts together; finger's rubber bands that were used to create the backward tension on the outter side of the fingers (because of the budget once again, that didn't allow to realize the backward motion by using servo motors with 'tendons' on the outter side). Subsequently, all the mentioned problems will be solved in the future models, hopefully.
